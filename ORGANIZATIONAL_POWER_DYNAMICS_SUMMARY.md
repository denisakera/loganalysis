# Organizational Power Dynamics Analysis
## Interactional Patterns and Communication Structure

**Analysis Date:** January 2026  
**Meeting Duration:** 114.25 minutes (6,855 seconds)  
**Participants:** 27 speakers  
**Total Topics Discussed:** 152 topics detected

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines power dynamics in organizational meetings through interactional patterns: how speakers relate to each other, how they engage with topics, and how power is enacted through conversational structure rather than formal authority.

**Key Finding:** Power in this organization is **decoupled from speaking time**. The most vocal participants do not necessarily control the agenda or influence decisions. Power appears through **agenda-setting capacity** (whose topics attract engagement), **structural control** (who can shift topics), and **epistemic authority** (whose contributions are accepted without challenge).

---

## Part I: Speaker-to-Speaker Relations

### 1.1 Participation Hierarchy

**Three-Tier Structure:**

**Tier 1 - High Participation (47.4% of speaking time):**
- **SPEAKER_09:** 18.9% (1,296 seconds)
- **SPEAKER_18:** 15.9% (1,089 seconds)
- **SPEAKER_25:** 12.6% (865 seconds)

**Tier 2 - Moderate Participation (15.3% of speaking time):**
- **SPEAKER_02:** 6.0% (412 seconds)
- **SPEAKER_19:** 5.8% (395 seconds)
- **SPEAKER_01:** 3.5% (242 seconds)

**Tier 3 - Low Participation (37.3% of speaking time):**
- 21 speakers share remaining time
- 11 speakers each account for less than 1% of speaking time

**Inequality Metrics:**
- **Gini Coefficient:** 0.656 (moderate inequality)
- **Top 3 speakers control:** 55.7% of speaking time (5.0x their proportional share)
- **Normalized Entropy:** 0.758 (moderate concentration)

### 1.2 Turn-Taking Patterns

**Turn Structure Reveals Interactional Strategies:**

| Speaker | Turns | Avg Turn Length | Strategy |
|---------|-------|----------------|----------|
| SPEAKER_09 | 33 | 41.8s | Many long turns (floor holding) |
| SPEAKER_18 | 27 | 43.7s | Fewer, longer turns |
| SPEAKER_07 | 21 | 5.7s | Many short turns (frequent participation) |
| SPEAKER_19 | 22 | 19.1s | Balanced strategy |

**Pattern:** Different speakers use different interactional strategies:
- **Long turns:** Extended floor holding (SPEAKER_09, SPEAKER_18)
- **Short turns:** Frequent brief contributions (SPEAKER_07)
- **Balanced:** Moderate turn length and frequency (SPEAKER_19)

### 1.3 Interruption Patterns

**Total Interruptions Detected:** 154 rapid turn-taking events (<0.5s gaps)

**Top Interrupters:**
- SPEAKER_09: 17 interruptions
- SPEAKER_19: 16 interruptions
- SPEAKER_02: 13 interruptions
- SPEAKER_18: 13 interruptions
- SPEAKER_25: 12 interruptions

**Interruption Tolerance (Who Maintains Floor Despite Interruptions):**
- **SPEAKER_09:** High tolerance (maintains floor despite interruptions)
- **SPEAKER_18:** Moderate tolerance
- **SPEAKER_25:** Moderate tolerance

**Power Insight:** High-participation speakers are both frequent interrupters and maintain floor despite interruptions, showing **dual power**: capacity to interrupt others and resist being interrupted.

### 1.4 Response-Oriented Network

**Who Orients to Whom:**

**Conversational Attractors (Who Elicits Extended Responses):**
- Speakers who receive responses with longest average duration:
  - **SPEAKER_18:** Elicits extended response chains
  - **SPEAKER_09:** Attracts frequent responses
  - **SPEAKER_02:** Moderate attractor

**Power Insight:** Some speakers become **conversational attractors** - others orient to them and extend their topics, even if they don't speak most.

### 1.5 Speaker Relations Summary

**Key Patterns:**
1. **Concentrated Participation:** Top 3 speakers account for nearly half of speaking time
2. **Diverse Strategies:** Different turn-taking strategies (long vs. short turns)
3. **Interruption Activity:** High-participation speakers are active interrupters
4. **Response Patterns:** Some speakers attract more responses than others
5. **Tolerance Asymmetries:** Some maintain floor despite interruptions (power as capacity to continue)

---

## Part II: Speaker-Topic Relations

### 2.1 Topic Proposal and Engagement

**152 Topics Detected Across Meeting**

**Topic Proposers (Who Introduces Topics):**
- **SPEAKER_09:** 20 topics (0% stabilization rate)
- **SPEAKER_18:** 17 topics (0% stabilization rate)
- **SPEAKER_19:** 16 topics (6.2% stabilization rate - 1 successful)
- **SPEAKER_02:** 16 topics (6.2% stabilization rate - 1 successful)
- **SPEAKER_25:** 12 topics (0% stabilization rate)

**Critical Finding:** **Power Decoupling**
- High-participation speakers (SPEAKER_09, SPEAKER_18) propose many topics but achieve **0% stabilization**
- Moderate-participation speakers (SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_19) achieve **6.2% stabilization**
- Low-participation speaker (SPEAKER_17) achieves **100% stabilization** (1/1 topic)

**Interpretation:** Speaking time ≠ Agenda-setting capacity. Floor control does not equal topic control.

### 2.2 Successful Topics (What Attracts Engagement)

**Only 3 Topics Achieved Stabilization (2.0% success rate):**

1. **TOPIC_19 (SPEAKER_02)** - Bank account/financial concerns
   - Content: "We opened the bank account to see how much we have to handle this... the bank is not in a good shape"
   - Responders: SPEAKER_23, SPEAKER_18
   - **Pattern:** Concrete financial/bureaucratic concerns attract engagement

2. **TOPIC_79 (SPEAKER_17)** - Problems discussion
   - Content: "It has its own problems"
   - Responders: SPEAKER_05 (immediate response)
   - **Pattern:** Brief, focused topics can succeed through immediate uptake

3. **TOPIC_99 (SPEAKER_19)** - Membership/citizenship question
   - Content: "I don't know if you have to be a citizen to be a member of the Muta"
   - Responders: SPEAKER_15, SPEAKER_25, SPEAKER_12
   - **Pattern:** Procedural questions attract multiple responders

**Common Characteristics of Successful Topics:**
- **Concrete and actionable** (financial, procedural, organizational)
- **Brief and focused** (not lengthy abstract discussions)
- **Attract immediate or near-immediate responses**
- **Multiple speakers engage** (not monopolized by proposer)

### 2.3 Failed Topics (What Doesn't Attract Engagement)

**149 Topics Failed (98.0% failure rate)**

**Reasons for Failure:**
- **142 topics:** Received responses but without semantic uptake (resistance or redirection)
- **7 topics:** Complete silence (no responses within 30 seconds)

**Pattern:** Most topics receive responses but fail to achieve **semantic orientation** - speakers address topics but don't take them up, indicating resistance or redirection.

### 2.4 Topic Closure Authority

**Who Can End Topics Without Contest:**

| Speaker | Total Closures | Uncontested Rate | Power Indicator |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **SPEAKER_19** | 12 | **100.0%** | Highest closure authority |
| **SPEAKER_02** | 14 | **92.9%** | High closure authority |
| **SPEAKER_07** | 12 | **91.7%** | High closure authority |
| **SPEAKER_09** | 24 | **83.3%** | Highest volume, high success |
| **SPEAKER_25** | 13 | 69.2% | Moderate closure authority |
| **SPEAKER_18** | 11 | 63.6% | Lower closure authority |

**Power Insight:** Some speakers can **reorganize the participation framework** by shifting topics, and others follow without repair. This is **structural power** - capacity to delimit what is relevant.

### 2.5 Asymmetric Topical Accountability

**Who Is Asked to Clarify/Justify:**

**High Accountability (Routinely Challenged):**
- **SPEAKER_03:** 1.00 demands per topic (every topic challenged)
- **SPEAKER_26:** 0.67 demands per topic
- **SPEAKER_24:** 0.33 demands per topic

**Low Accountability (Never Challenged):**
- **SPEAKER_09:** 0.00 demands per topic (20 topics, 0 challenges)
- **SPEAKER_19:** 0.00 demands per topic (16 topics, 0 challenges)
- **SPEAKER_18:** 0.12 demands per topic (17 topics, 2 challenges)

**Power Insight:** Uneven accountability signals **differential epistemic standing**:
- **Low accountability** = Epistemic authority (contributions accepted without challenge)
- **High accountability** = Lower epistemic standing (must justify contributions)

### 2.6 Topic Hijacking and Reframing

**Topic Control Patterns:**

- **3 hijacking/reframing cases** detected (subtle control while preserving legitimacy)
- **202 complete shifts** (topics ignored or redirected)
- **0 alignment cases** (no cases of maintaining topic frame)

**Who Controls Topics:**
- **SPEAKER_09:** 32 complete shifts (most redirective capacity)
- **SPEAKER_18:** 1 hijacking, 15 shifts (subtle control + redirection)
- **SPEAKER_19:** 1 hijacking, 3 shifts (subtle control)

**Power Insight:** Most responses are **complete shifts** rather than subtle reframing, indicating topics are frequently ignored or redirected rather than transformed.

- **Accountability:** 0.00 (never challenged - epistemic authority)
- **Interruption Activity:** 17 interruptions (active interrupter)
- **Power Type:** **Structural + Epistemic Authority** but **Low Agenda-Setting Capacity**
- **Interpretation:** Holds floor and can shift topics, but topics don't attract engagement. Power through structural control, not agenda setting.

**SPEAKER_18: High Participation, Moderate Control**
- **Speaking Time:** 15.9% (second highest)
- **Topic Proposals:** 17 topics
- **Stabilization Rate:** 0% (no successful agenda setting)

- **Interpretation:** Moderate participation but high closure authority and successful topic (bank account concerns).

**SPEAKER_17: Strategic Success**
- **Speaking Time:** <1% (very low)
- **Topic Proposals:** 1 topic
- **Stabilization Rate:** 100% (perfect success)
- **Power Type:** **Strategic Agenda Setting**
- **Interpretation:** Minimal participation but perfect topic success rate. Shows **strategic topic selection** can achieve agenda setting despite low overall participation.

**SPEAKER_03: Lower Epistemic Standing**
- **Speaking Time:** 1.1% (low)
- **Topic Proposals:** 4 topics
- **Accountability:** 1.00 (every topic challenged)
- **Power Type:** **Lower Epistemic Authority**
- **Interpretation:** Must justify every contribution, indicating lower epistemic standing in the group.

### 3.2 Power Dimensions

**Power appears in multiple dimensions:**

1. **Floor Control** (Speaking Time)
   - SPEAKER_09, SPEAKER_18, SPEAKER_25 dominate speaking time
   - But this doesn't translate to agenda-setting power

2. **Agenda-Setting Capacity** (Topic Stabilization)
   - SPEAKER_17, SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_19 achieve stabilization
   - Decoupled from speaking time

3. **Structural Control** (Topic Closure Authority)
   - SPEAKER_19, SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_07 can shift topics without contest
   - Capacity to reorganize participation framework

4. **Epistemic Authority** (Accountability Patterns)
   - SPEAKER_09, SPEAKER_19 never challenged
   - SPEAKER_03 routinely challenged
   - Uneven epistemic standing

5. **Response Attraction** (Conversational Attractors)
   - Some speakers elicit extended responses
   - Power through attracting orientation, not just speaking

### 3.3 Power Decoupling: Key Finding

**Speaking Time ≠ Power**

| Speaker | Speaking Time | Agenda Setting | Structural Control | Epistemic Authority |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| SPEAKER_09 | 18.9% (highest) | 0% (lowest) | 83.3% (high) | High (0 accountability) |
| SPEAKER_18 | 15.9% (high) | 0% (lowest) | 63.6% (moderate) | High (0.12 accountability) |
| SPEAKER_19 | 5.8% (moderate) | 6.2% (successful) | 100% (highest) | High (0 accountability) |
| SPEAKER_17 | <1% (lowest) | 100% (highest) | N/A | N/A |

**Critical Insight:** The most vocal participants (SPEAKER_09, SPEAKER_18) do **not** control the agenda. Power is distributed across different dimensions, and high participation does not guarantee influence.

## Part IV: Organizational Implications

### 4.1 Communication Structure

**Current Patterns:**
1. **Highly Concentrated Participation:** Top 3 speakers account for 47.4% of speaking time
2. **Competitive Discourse:** Only 2% of topics achieve stabilization (highly competitive)
3. **Power Decoupling:** Floor control ≠ Agenda control
4. **Epistemic Hierarchy:** Uneven accountability reveals differential standing

### 4.2 Speaker Roles

**Based on Analysis:**

**Floor Holders (High Participation, Low Influence):**
- SPEAKER_09, SPEAKER_18, SPEAKER_25

## Part VI: Speaker Animal Metaphors - Power Dynamics as Organizational Jungle

### 6.1 Apex Predators (Strategic Power)

**🦅 SPEAKER_19: The Eagle Who Soars Above the Noise**
- **Speaking Time:** 5.8% (moderate)
- **Power Profile:** Perfect closure authority (100%) + successful agenda setting (6.2%) + epistemic authority (never challenged)
- **Metaphor:** Soars above, strikes with precision, doesn't need volume
- **Jungle Role:** Apex predator - strategic hunter with perfect success rate
- **The Tale:** While others roared and charged below, the eagle spoke only 5.8% of the time. But when the eagle spoke, topics stabilized. When the eagle shifted topics, others followed without question (100% closure authority). The smallest of the apex predators by volume, but the most successful by strategy. Sometimes the quietest predator is the most successful.

**🐺 SPEAKER_02: The Wolf Who Hunts in Packs (And Actually Catches Prey)**
- **Speaking Time:** 6.0% (moderate)
- **Power Profile:** High closure authority (92.9%) + successful agenda setting (bank account topic)
- **Metaphor:** Pack hunter, strategic, successful
- **Jungle Role:** Pack leader - strategic and successful
- **The Tale:** A wolf hunted strategically, speaking only 6.0% of the time. But when the wolf howled about the bank account, others listened. While lions roared with zero success, the wolf succeeded through strategy. One successful catch is worth more than twenty failed charges.

**🐆 SPEAKER_17: The Leopard Who Strikes Once and Succeeds**
- **Speaking Time:** <1% (very low)
- **Power Profile:** Perfect topic success (100% - 1/1 topic)
- **Metaphor:** Stealthy, strikes rarely but with perfect success
- **Jungle Role:** Stealth predator - minimal presence, maximum success
- **The Tale:** A leopard moved silently, speaking less than 1% of the time. But when the leopard said "It has its own problems," others responded immediately. While lions roared for 18.9% of the time with zero success, the leopard whispered once and caught prey. Sometimes the quietest strike is the most effective.

### 6.2 Dominant Herbivores (High Volume, Low Influence)

**🦁 SPEAKER_09: The Roaring Lion Who Never Catches Prey**
- **Speaking Time:** 18.9% (highest)
- **Power Profile:** Structural control (83.3% closure) + epistemic authority (never challenged) but 0% topic stabilization
- **Metaphor:** Roars loudly but doesn't always catch prey
- **Jungle Role:** Apex predator in volume, but not always successful hunter
- **The Tale:** Once upon a time, there lived a mighty lion who roared louder than all others (18.9% of the jungle's soundscape). The lion could shift conversations like changing hunting grounds, and no one dared challenge the lion's contributions. But here's the twist: despite all the roaring, the lion's 20 topics never caught prey. Like a lion who roars magnificently but watches all the gazelles run away, volume and dominance don't guarantee success.

**🐘 SPEAKER_18: The Elephant Who Never Forgets (But Others Do)**
- **Speaking Time:** 15.9% (second highest)
- **Power Profile:** Large presence, longest turns (43.7s average), but 0% topic stabilization
- **Metaphor:** Takes up space, long memory, but not predatory
- **Jungle Role:** Large herbivore - significant presence but not strategic hunter
- **The Tale:** An elephant with an impressive memory could hold conversations for 43.7 seconds at a time - longer than any other creature. The elephant took up 15.9% of the jungle's space. But here's the comedy: the elephant proposed 17 topics, and not a single one was remembered. Like an elephant who remembers everything but whose stories are forgotten by others, having a long memory doesn't mean others will remember what you said.

**🦏 SPEAKER_25: The Rhinoceros Who Charges But Never Arrives**
- **Speaking Time:** 12.6% (third highest)
- **Power Profile:** Powerful charge, sustained floor-holding, but 0% topic stabilization
- **Metaphor:** Powerful charge, thick skin, but not agile
- **Jungle Role:** Powerful herbivore - strong presence but not strategic
- **The Tale:** A rhinoceros charged forward with great power, taking up 12.6% of the jungle's space. The rhino had thick skin - balanced interruption patterns showed the rhino was neither predator nor prey. But here's the joke: the rhino charged forward with 12 topics, and not a single one reached its destination. Like a rhinoceros who charges magnificently but never arrives anywhere, power without strategy is just running in circles.

### 6.3 Agile Foragers (Strategic Positioning)

**🐒 SPEAKER_07: The Monkey Who Moves Too Fast to Catch**
- **Speaking Time:** 1.7% (low)
- **Power Profile:** Many short turns (5.7s average), high closure authority (91.7%)
- **Metaphor:** Agile, frequent brief movements, strategic positioning
- **Jungle Role:** Agile forager - frequent brief contributions, strategic positioning
- **The Tale:** A monkey swung from branch to branch, making 21 brief contributions (5.7 seconds each). The monkey is frequently interrupted but keeps moving. Like a monkey who swings too fast to be caught, SPEAKER_07 makes brief contributions that others can't pin down. Sometimes moving too fast means you never arrive anywhere, but at least you're never caught.

**🦊 SPEAKER_01: The Fox Who Responds to Everyone's Topics**
- **Speaking Time:** 3.5% (moderate)
- **Power Profile:** Most active responder, engages with many topics
- **Metaphor:** Clever, responsive, adapts to others' topics
- **Jungle Role:** Clever scavenger - responds to others' topics
- **The Tale:** A clever fox never set their own topics but responded to everyone else's. While others fought to set the agenda, the fox simply responded. Like a fox who's clever enough to scavenge from all hunters, SPEAKER_01 engages with many topics without the burden of setting them. You don't need to hunt to eat.

### 6.4 Vulnerable Prey (Challenged Standing)

**🐢 SPEAKER_03: The Tortoise Who Must Justify Every Step**
- **Speaking Time:** 1.1% (low)
- **Power Profile:** Highest accountability (1.00 - every topic challenged)
- **Metaphor:** Steady but vulnerable, frequently challenged
- **Jungle Role:** Vulnerable herbivore - steady but frequently challenged
- **The Tale:** A tortoise moved slowly, proposing 4 topics. But every single topic was challenged. While eagles soared unchallenged and lions roared without question, the tortoise crawled forward, justifying each movement. Like a tortoise who can close topics but can't open them without challenge, sometimes you can control where others go, but not what they think of you.

**🦎 SPEAKER_26: The Lizard Who's Always Questioned**
- **Power Profile:** High accountability (0.67 - 2/3 topics challenged)
- **Metaphor:** Small, frequently questioned, lower standing
- **Jungle Role:** Small prey - frequently questioned
- **The Tale:** A small lizard proposed 3 topics. Two out of three were challenged. While larger animals spoke without question, the lizard was frequently asked to explain. Like a lizard who's always questioned but keeps proposing topics anyway, SPEAKER_26 shows resilience. Size doesn't determine persistence.

### 6.5 Silent Presence (Marginalized)

**🐁 11 Speakers: The Silent Mice Who Watch the Jungle**
- **Power Profile:** <1% speaking time each, limited participation, few/no topic proposals
- **Metaphor:** Present but rarely seen or heard
- **Jungle Role:** Prey animals - present but rarely active
- **The Tale:** Eleven small mice watched from the shadows. Each mouse spoke less than 1% of the time. They rarely proposed topics, rarely responded, rarely participated. But they were there, watching lions roar, elephants remember, eagles soar, and wolves hunt. While the jungle roared with competition, the mice watched silently. They're in the jungle, but they're not of the jungle.

### 6.6 Complete Animal Assignment Table

| Speaker | Animal | Speaking Time | Topic Success | Closure Authority | Accountability | Power Type |
|---------|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| **SPEAKER_19** | 🦅 Eagle | 5.8% | 6.2% | 100% | 0.00 | Strategic Power |
| **SPEAKER_02** | 🐺 Wolf | 6.0% | 6.2% | 92.9% | 0.19 | Strategic Power |
| **SPEAKER_17** | 🐆 Leopard | <1% | 100% | N/A | N/A | Strategic Success |
| **SPEAKER_09** | 🦁 Lion | 18.9% | 0% | 83.3% | 0.00 | Volume Dominance |
| **SPEAKER_18** | 🐘 Elephant | 15.9% | 0% | 63.6% | 0.12 | Volume Dominance |
| **SPEAKER_25** | 🦏 Rhinoceros | 12.6% | 0% | 69.2% | 0.25 | Volume Dominance |
| **SPEAKER_07** | 🐒 Monkey | 1.7% | 0% | 91.7% | 0.20 | Agile Forager |
| **SPEAKER_01** | 🦊 Fox | 3.5% | 0% | N/A | N/A | Responsive |
| **SPEAKER_03** | 🐢 Tortoise | 1.1% | 0% | 100% | 1.00 | Challenged |
| **SPEAKER_26** | 🦎 Lizard | Low | 0% | N/A | 0.67 | Challenged |
| **11 Speakers** | 🐁 Mice | <1% each | 0% | Various | Various | Marginalized |

### 6.7 Key Insights from Animal Metaphors

1. **Volume ≠ Success:** Lions and elephants dominate volume but don't catch prey (topics don't stabilize)
2. **Strategy > Volume:** Eagles, wolves, and leopards succeed through strategy, not volume
3. **Different Roles:** Some are predators (agenda setters), some are herbivores (floor holders), some are prey (challenged)
4. **Jungle Hierarchy:** Clear hierarchy from apex predators to marginalized prey
5. **Power Decoupling:** Dominant animals (lions) don't always succeed - strategic animals (eagles) do

**The Organizational Jungle:**
- Competitive ecosystem where only 2% of topics succeed
- Clear hierarchy from apex predators to marginalized prey
- Multiple survival strategies: Volume (lions), strategy (eagles), agility (monkeys)
- Power decoupling: Dominant presence ≠ successful hunting

**Metaphor Summary:**
- **🦅 Eagles & 🐺 Wolves:** Strategic hunters who succeed through precision
- **🦁 Lions & 🐘 Elephants:** Dominant presence but not always successful
- **🐆 Leopards:** Stealthy success despite minimal presence
- **🐒 Monkeys & 🦊 Foxes:** Agile and responsive, adapt to environment
- **🐢 Tortoises & 🦎 Lizards:** Vulnerable, frequently challenged
- **🐁 Mice:** Present but marginalized, rarely heard

### 6.8 How Speakers Imagine the Institution: The Jungle as They See It

Based on topic content analysis, speakers reveal different imaginations of the organization (Tami as an "amuta" - NGO). These imaginations reveal power positions and strategic orientations:

#### **The NGO as a "Vessel" or "Tool" (SPEAKER_18, SPEAKER_09)**

**The Tale:** Some speakers imagine the NGO as merely a legal vessel - a tool to enable the physical space to exist. SPEAKER_18 describes it: "Tami is a legal amuta... we've been using the NGO to essentially be a vehicle for just having TAMI, like, existing. It has no official... it's completely different, essentially. There is TAMI, the physical, and..."

**The Irony:** The NGO is imagined as a bureaucratic necessity, not a meaningful structure. Like a tool that's necessary but not valued, the NGO exists to pay rent and have a bank account - "just use it as something that we can do a little bit better than having somebody in the space who has a bank account."

**Power Position:** These speakers (SPEAKER_18, SPEAKER_09) dominate speaking time but their institutional imagination is **instrumental** - the NGO is a means to an end, not an end in itself. This aligns with their 0% topic stabilization - they imagine the institution as a tool, but don't control what the tool is used for.

**The Moral:** When you imagine the institution as just a vessel, you may hold the vessel but not control what fills it.

#### **The NGO as a "Bureaucratic Burden" (SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_09)**

**The Tale:** Some speakers imagine the NGO as a bureaucratic burden that must be managed. SPEAKER_02 expresses frustration: "dealing with these things, with bureaucracy and stuff like that, it's something that I think most of us don't like. Tommy, again, the NGO is the vessel, right? It's just the thing that, you know, the least pain that we could..."

**The Irony:** Despite imagining bureaucracy as a burden, SPEAKER_02 achieves successful agenda setting through concrete bureaucratic topics (bank account concerns). The speaker who imagines bureaucracy as a burden is the one who successfully sets the agenda through bureaucratic concerns.

**Power Position:** SPEAKER_02 imagines the institution as a **necessary evil** but uses this imagination strategically - focusing on concrete bureaucratic problems that attract engagement. This contrasts with SPEAKER_09, who also imagines bureaucracy as burden but achieves 0% topic stabilization.

**The Moral:** The speaker who imagines bureaucracy as burden but addresses it strategically succeeds. The speaker who imagines it as burden and avoids it fails.

---

#### **The NGO as "Open and Accessible" (SPEAKER_18)**

**The Tale:** SPEAKER_18 imagines the institution as fundamentally open: "Tami is open, right? It always has been open, right? Every person here... if you wanted a week ago, a year ago, today, tomorrow, you wanted to be a part of the Amutah... you can do it today, you could have done it yesterday, and you can do it tomorrow."

**The Irony:** SPEAKER_18 imagines the institution as open and accessible, yet membership "has not been historically relevant" - members have "no other like effect or any other like decision power as opposed to anyone that comes through the door." The institution is imagined as open, but formal membership doesn't matter.

**Power Position:** SPEAKER_18 imagines the institution as **informal and open**, yet this imagination doesn't translate to successful agenda setting (0% stabilization). The speaker who imagines openness doesn't control what happens in that open space.

**The Moral:** Imagining the institution as open doesn't mean you control what happens in that openness.

---

#### **The NGO as "Vulnerable to Government Intervention" (SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_09)**

**The Tale:** Some speakers imagine the NGO as vulnerable to external threats. SPEAKER_02 expresses fear: "we are very afraid that this lack might result some asshole in the government saying, hey, no, you're not playing by the rules. TAMI cannot exist anymore because you've violated for the past few years."

**The Irony:** The fear of government intervention drives bureaucratic compliance, but this fear-based imagination doesn't always translate to successful agenda setting. SPEAKER_02 uses this fear strategically (successful topic), while SPEAKER_09 expresses similar concerns but achieves 0% stabilization.

**Power Position:** Speakers imagine the institution as **vulnerable and threatened**, but only some use this imagination strategically. The fear of external threat becomes a source of power for those who can translate it into concrete action.

**The Moral:** Fear of external threat can drive action, but only if channeled strategically.

---

#### **The NGO as "Informal vs. Formal Structure" (Multiple Speakers)**

**The Tale:** There's a tension between how speakers imagine the institution informally (as an open space) versus formally (as a legal structure with protocols, budgets, decisions). SPEAKER_09 acknowledges: "TAMI has been working... under the officially its project, but we never actually formalized that relationship, which is slightly problematic, but easily solved."

**The Irony:** Speakers acknowledge the lack of formalization as "problematic" but also as "easily solved" - suggesting the formal structure is imagined as both necessary and trivial. The institution is imagined as both informal (the physical space) and formal (the legal entity), but these imaginations don't align.

**Power Position:** Speakers who navigate this tension strategically (SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_19) achieve agenda setting. Speakers who imagine the institution as purely informal (SPEAKER_18) or purely formal (SPEAKER_09) struggle with agenda setting.

**The Moral:** The institution exists in the tension between informal and formal - those who navigate this tension succeed.

---

#### **The NGO as "Problems to Solve" (SPEAKER_17, SPEAKER_02)**

**The Tale:** Some speakers imagine the institution through its problems. SPEAKER_17 says simply: "It has its own problems" - and this brief statement achieves 100% topic stabilization. SPEAKER_02 focuses on concrete problems: "the bank is not in a good shape" - and this achieves stabilization.

**The Irony:** The speakers who imagine the institution through its problems are the ones who succeed. The briefest problem statement ("It has its own problems") achieves perfect success, while lengthy descriptions of the institution's structure achieve 0% success.

**Power Position:** Speakers who imagine the institution as **problems to solve** achieve agenda setting. This contrasts with speakers who imagine it as structure, vessel, or burden - those imaginations don't attract engagement.

**The Moral:** Sometimes the simplest problem statement is the most powerful. Imagining the institution through its problems attracts more engagement than imagining it through its structure.

---

#### **Summary: Institutional Imagination and Power**

**Different imaginations reveal different power positions:**

1. **Instrumental Imagination (Vessel/Tool):** SPEAKER_18, SPEAKER_09
   - Imagines NGO as means to an end
   - High speaking time, 0% topic stabilization
   - **Power:** Structural control without agenda setting

2. **Strategic Problem-Solving Imagination:** SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_17
   - Imagines NGO through concrete problems
   - Successful agenda setting
   - **Power:** Strategic agenda control

3. **Open/Accessible Imagination:** SPEAKER_18
   - Imagines NGO as fundamentally open
   - 0% topic stabilization
   - **Power:** High participation without agenda control

4. **Vulnerable/Threatened Imagination:** SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_09
   - Imagines NGO as vulnerable to external threats
   - Mixed success (SPEAKER_02 succeeds, SPEAKER_09 fails)
   - **Power:** Strategic use of fear vs. unproductive fear

**Key Insight:** How speakers imagine the institution reveals their power position. Those who imagine it through **concrete problems** succeed. Those who imagine it through **structure, vessel, or openness** struggle with agenda setting.

**The Organizational Jungle as Imagined:**
- Some see it as a vessel (necessary but not meaningful)
- Some see it as a burden (bureaucracy to manage)
- Some see it as open (accessible but without formal power)
- Some see it as vulnerable (threatened by external forces)
- Some see it as problems (concrete issues to solve)

**The successful hunters (eagles, wolves, leopards) imagine the institution through problems. The unsuccessful hunters (lions, elephants) imagine it through structure.**

### 6.3 Marginalized Speakers

**11 Speakers with <1% Speaking Time:**
- Limited participation opportunities
- Few or no topic proposals
- Rarely respond to topics
- **Pattern:** Marginalized in interactional structure

**Recommendation:** Consider structured facilitation to ensure these voices are heard.

### 6.4 Response Patterns

**Most Active Responders:**
- **SPEAKER_01:** Most active responder (engages with many topics)
- **SPEAKER_18:** High response activity
- **SPEAKER_25:** Frequent responder

**Pattern:** Some speakers function primarily as **responders** rather than **proposers**, showing different interactional roles.

## Part VIII: Methodological Note

This analysis uses **interactional metrics** to examine power dynamics:
- **Not semantic interpretation** (does not evaluate content quality or correctness)
- **Not intentional inference** (does not assume speaker intentions)
- **Structural patterns only** (observable interactional features)

**Power is operationalized as:**
- Capacity to set agenda (topic stabilization)
- Capacity to control structure (topic closure)
- Capacity to maintain floor (interruption tolerance)
- Epistemic authority (accountability patterns)
- Response attraction (conversational attractors)

All findings are **descriptive and structural**, not normative. Interpretation of what these patterns mean for the organization is left to organizational leadership and participants.

## Conclusion

Power in this organization is **multidimensional and decoupled from speaking time**. The most vocal participants do not necessarily control the agenda. Power appears through:

1. **Agenda-Setting Capacity** (whose topics attract engagement)
2. **Structural Control** (who can shift topics)
3. **Epistemic Authority** (whose contributions are accepted)
4. **Response Attraction** (who becomes conversational attractor)

Understanding these patterns can help the organization:
- Recognize different forms of influence
- Support strategic agenda setting
- Address participation imbalances
- Create more inclusive communication structures

**All analyses are descriptive and structural.** The interpretation of what these patterns mean for organizational effectiveness and decision-making is a matter for organizational leadership and participants to determine.

### 8.1 Speaker-to-Speaker Relations

**Participation Structure:**
- **Highly concentrated:** Top 3 speakers = 47.4% of speaking time
- **Three-tier hierarchy:** High (47.4%), Moderate (15.3%), Low (37.3%)
- **Competitive dynamics:** High-participation speakers interrupt each other frequently

**Key Relationships:**
- **SPEAKER_09 ↔ SPEAKER_18:** Competitive relationship, both hold floor but neither controls agenda
- **SPEAKER_19:** Strategic power hub - can set agenda and shift topics
- **SPEAKER_02:** Balanced power - successful agenda setting + structural control

### 8.2 Speaker-Topic Relations

**Agenda-Setting Patterns:**
- **152 topics discussed** across meeting
- **Only 3 topics stabilized** (2.0% success rate) - highly competitive discourse

- **Strategic success:** Some speakers achieve agenda setting through strategic topic selection

**Successful Topics:**
- Concrete, actionable (financial, procedural, organizational)
- Brief, focused content
- Immediate responses
- Multiple speaker engagement

**Failed Topics:**
- Abstract or disconnected
- Lengthy without clear focus
- Don't align with group concerns

### 8.3 Overall Power Dynamics

2. **Agenda-Setting Capacity** (Topic Stabilization): SPEAKER_17, SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_19
3. **Structural Control** (Topic Closure): SPEAKER_19, SPEAKER_02, SPEAKER_07
4. **Epistemic Authority** (Accountability): SPEAKER_09, SPEAKER_19 (never challenged)
5. **Response Attraction** (Conversational Attractors): Some speakers elicit extended responses

**Critical Finding:** Power is **multidimensional and decoupled from speaking time**. The most vocal participants do not necessarily control the agenda.

### 8.4 Organizational Implications

**Current State:**
- Highly competitive discourse (2% topic success)
- Concentrated participation (top 3 = 47.4% of time)
- Power decoupling (floor control ≠ agenda control)
- Epistemic hierarchy (uneven accountability)

**Recommendations:**
1. Address participation imbalance
2. Recognize multiple forms of power
3. Support strategic agenda setting
4. Address epistemic asymmetries
5. Consider structured facilitation

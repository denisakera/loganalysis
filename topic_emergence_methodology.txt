METHODOLOGICAL NOTE: TOPIC EMERGENCE AS INTERACTIONAL PHENOMENON

This analysis operationalizes topics as emergent interactional objects, not as predefined
themes or semantic categories. Topics exist only through observable interaction patterns.

Key Operationalizations:

1. Topic Proposal Detection:
   - Uses semantic similarity (TF-IDF + cosine similarity) to identify new lexical clusters
   - Threshold: 0.25 similarity (turns below this threshold relative to preceding window
     are considered topic proposals)
   - Window size: 5 preceding turns for comparison
   - No keyword matching or predefined themes

2. Topic Stabilization:
   - A topic is stabilized only if at least one other speaker responds with semantic
     overlap exceeding 0.3 similarity
   - Response window: 30 seconds after topic proposal
   - Stabilization = successful topic adoption (agenda setting through uptake)

3. Topic Failure:
   - Failed (silence): Topic followed by >5 seconds of silence
   - Failed (no uptake): Topic followed by responses but without semantic overlap
   - Failure indicates lack of interactional uptake

4. Speaker Orientation:
   - Uptake: Response with semantic similarity ≥0.3
   - Redirection: Response with similarity 0.3-0.6 (topic transformation)
   - Monopolization: Proposer extends topic without others (proposer turns > 2x others)

5. Agenda Setting as Uptake:
   - Topic introduction alone does not equal agenda setting
   - Agenda setting occurs only when others orient to the topic
   - Stabilized topics = successful agenda setting
   - Failed topics = failed agenda setting

Interpretive Constraints:
- No assignment of semantic authority or correctness to any topic
- No inference of intent or strategy
- All topic dynamics grounded in observable interaction patterns
- Topics are interactional objects, not abstract concepts
- Resistance and silence are interactional responses, not absences

Visualization Approach:
- Topic timeline: Shows emergence, stabilization, and decay over time
- Speaker-topic network: Bipartite graph showing who proposes and who responds
- Topic trajectories: Shows how topics travel between speakers or stall
- All visualizations treat topics as emergent, not predefined

This approach respects the interactional nature of topics, showing how they emerge,
stabilize, transform, or fail through observable patterns of uptake, resistance, and
redirection.

TAMI cannot exist anymore because you've violated for the past few years. For this, we need to do a few things. Locally in TAMI, we need to be better in following these because Because it's a binary decision. You either exist or you don't. It doesn't mean anything for the ongoing participation.

TOPIC CONTENT:
Yeah, so it's like mainly, as far as I can see, again, I'm not an expert in the subject, as far as you can see, a healthy quote unquote NGO is like having those meetings of the board of direct making the decision and having that protocol, pretty much that's it. But have it on something that you can show outside. For instance, even if it's obvious to us that we have these workshops and everything, just saying as an officially that we made a meeting and said like, oh, we're allocating some money for this workshop, That's already good enough. Even internally nothing changed. But just saying that and having that is like so much better.

So basically activities that NGOs do, they have a few things that you have to list. Essentially, we are sort of doing this thing nowadays, right? It's just we're doing it sort of in bulk and in a very general manner. So we're just saying like, you know what, we had like, I don't know, Like, you know, this many, like, you know, some random amount. Yeah, so just like an average amount of, let's say, order of magnitude of how many hours we did, like, some activities in TAMI. This is what we're doing currently. I'm not sure it's actually, flawed in a very substantial way. Again, the activity here is very gray in the way that it happens. Of course. Yeah, of course. It's weird, and it's not necessarily as easy to communicate what happens. But I just want to sort of give because I've been in a few meetings like this over the years. I've set up a few of these over the years, and I just wanted to sort of, like, for anyone who is interested in doing stuff, because I think that the biggest thing to keep in mind is Tami is open, right? It always has been open, right? Every person here, you might have not known it, but if you wanted a week ago, a year ago, today, tomorrow, you wanted to be a part of the Amuta, you wanted to take part in documenting stuff, you wanted to take part in helping with all of these things, with recording activities, with doing any of these things, you can do it today, you could have done it yesterday, and you can do it tomorrow. Now, the biggest point here is that because at the end of the day, we're going to walk out of here, right, and every one of us, and I don't know what the conclusion is going to be, But the point is that this is the biggest thing. It's always open and you can always take part in it. It's crucially important because it sort of has to happen and there has never been a limiting factor in doing things better. The only limiting factor is doing it. It's just doing it. And I'm sure that there are many discussions that can be made about good and bad and what should be done and should not be done. But the point is that it just requires doing. And this is the biggest thing. So if you want to take it in any way, you can literally do it. So this is my biggest point.

Maybe. I don't know if they exposed it. But your ID will still be redacted. So this is what it means practically. And maybe, I don't know if our terms of condition says that or not, but paying the minimum amount a month or whatever for the membership of the junta, which I think for us is zero. I don't think you actually need to pay monthly. Do you know any? Okay. So we don't have it even. we don't we don't no no no not not for if you if you find this if you find that you want to participate in this it'll help to have more people that i can you know we can share them No, not only point out, but share the workload also. If there is something that you can help with, it's easier for me to be like, oh, OK, I can choose you or vote you in for a specific position in order to help with having a better NGO.

Yes, so the point... I'm sorry for being late. I'm sorry for not hearing everything that came before what I'm responding to. So maybe you guys talked about this before already, I don't know. I'm just saying, me personally, I had two reasons to get out of it. One was that I wasn't physically that involved with TAMI for a long time, and it felt really weird to be chair of a Namuta, which I visit occasionally, but I'm not really like an active member of. And the second reason was because I'm planning in the summer to go to England for three years or maybe forever. thought it would probably be better for somebody who stays in Israel. But I've been thinking about it since Sunday, or something like that, when Cefil brought it up. No, I mean, you brought up the fact that you want to have a meeting, and you have some vague plan that I didn't really understand. And sort of this came about, this meeting came about, I guess partially as a result of that. And because Jeremy is already a member of the Amutani, lives in Pittsburgh for the last few years, and I don't think anybody gives a damn about that, I'm not sure that's an actual problem for Tommy that I'm not in Israel. So the only thing remaining is my vague unease with being... a non-practicing chairman. So just to sum it up, if there's any good reason to make any changes to Dhammuta, I'm all for it, of course, and I don't have any problem with somebody replacing me, but I no longer require somebody to replace me.

So I would just respond, I just want to respond. Alon, I don't know if you heard what we mentioned this, but this is actually, because we want to, we mentioned this before you came in, because we want to make our Dalmuta healthier, legally and have this decision and protocol which is required for the 46 from the tax authorities. Having the position that you have means that you essentially will have to do more than what you did years before. If you are OK with that, that's great. If you're not, you should know that this is the change that we want to essentially do, is have that external decisions so we can apply for 46 as soon as possible. If it's possible. We don't know yet if it's possible. I'll talk tomorrow with our accountant to see if it's possible. One last thing. Oh, if it's, and I should say, if it's not possible, then tying into what Giddy said, having a backup NGO is not a bad idea in my mind. So we at least can have this and have this properly this time, because we have all the knowledge that we didn't have before. And if you want to sign for that also, that's the same. Everything I said until this point still applies, and you can be, at the TAMI NGO and it can be in the new one, whatever. But like tomorrow we know and I will post and I will say like, okay, he said no or he said yes and this is what we need to do. But having...

Like, sure, you might have bad stuff to say on the management of this NGO, because like any number of reasons, like I've had my clashes with the tax authority many times for... like no apparent like where they were wrong but they clashed with me anyway so you can't ever tell and i have horror stories so starting fresh without any history sure you'll have to do a bunch of stuff but that's negligible relatively than trying to get back from a position where someone is like clashing with you actively from the authorities

So basically, from my current understanding, there is the issue of the 46. If you want to do that, we presumably need to make some changes to the legal entity of the Almuta. But on the other hand, once we start making changes to the legal entity of the Almuta, we will need to definitely refresh the member list, get people that are more active. and there is a certain fear that, you know, as we make those changes and as the legal entity of Domota, it might have some more impact on the day-to-day of preparations of TAMI and basically we need to have people that we trust that those changes will be positive and won't be abused and it won't like eventually collapse TAMI itself.

just just just just for clarification right for so just for just for just for just for just for just for clarification right currently legally speaking there is no need to make any changes to the amuta for as legal requirements to get anything, not the 46. We are complying with the law fully to get 46. Legal wise, yes. Legal-wise, we're fully compliant with it. It's still subject for review. It's a soft issue. The review is by people who might have interests, who might have a certain decision-making process. This is the majority of the discussion. It's not a clear-cut legal thing. Also, formally speaking, It's not, let's say, a purely legal problem. You could argue theoretically that if things are misreported or something like that, it's not good, right? That might be a problem. But this is a very, let's say, on a, it's an ad hoc thing.

Okay, so I want to say something that maybe it's above these topics, but for me it's really important about what Tami is for me. I'm not a long time here, but I've known many people and liked or hated different ways of approaching how to do things. The heart of Tami, as I see it, is to allow everyone to be whatever they want and to do how they want things and to solve things. I really like what Yair said about the water. Fine, we can pay a lot of money, everybody can bring their own donation and bring an instalato, but I like that Yair had an experience and people who were here, and I wish I could be, I've been sick, but I will definitely be a part of other things like that. I think that's the heart of TAMI. Even if TAMI will not survive something that will be destroyed or fallen, the fun about doing things and trying to solve them, even if it seems like you wouldn't be able to do that, that's what TAMI is about. And I think that when we are talking about money, Even if it's for a good thing that will improve TAMI as a place, as a community, as accessories and appliances that are here, it's starting to put some kind of rot in that heart. People are starting to feel uncomfortable. in this kind of vibes we can see like some kind of different camps starting to build about how Tami should be which I think it's like a signal of we shouldn't go in that path because I think Tami should be like even as a voting thing like people can The things we're doing now is very important about many other things. If there is a water issue, we can all meet if someone would want to come or not to come, and vote how we think we should solve this issue, but not by paying to someone to do that, but how we should do that, and everybody can suggest things, and it could take days or weeks to find a solution. Maybe we would not find one. But I think that's one of the things, and I think everything you're suggesting about to improve time in many ways that maybe having more money will help, I think that these are things that we can all decide together how to solve them by each one's skills. If someone is an accountant, he can help.

For insurance for basically protecting the amutah from the legal entity that is sort of responsible for this place. So, it's important to say, right? It's important to say, we, so basically if you are a member of the Amutah, it's a concern of you. I don't, by the way, I think that anyone that is interested in, I don't know, it's kind of a weird thing because I mean, it's really the responsibility of the board of directors. And if you're not in the board of directors, it's a weird thing for you to worry about. Now, I think if you want to be a part of the board of directors and you say, this is something I want because I want to be a part of the board of directors, then I think it's cool. I mean, it's kind of weird otherwise, I think.

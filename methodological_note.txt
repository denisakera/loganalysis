METHODOLOGICAL NOTE: OPERATIONALIZING POWER DYNAMICS

This analysis operationalizes interactional power dynamics through structural features
of conversation, not through semantic interpretation or assumptions about authority.

Key Operationalizations:

1. Speaking Time Dominance: Measured as total duration of non-filler utterances per
   speaker, expressed as absolute time and percentage of total meeting duration.

2. Turn-Taking Structure: Quantifies the number of turns per speaker and average turn
   length. Asymmetries emerge when some speakers have many short turns while others
   have few long turns, indicating different interactional strategies.

3. Interruption Proxy: Detects rapid turn-taking (gaps < 0.5s) between different
   speakers as a proxy for interruption behavior. This is a structural indicator,
   not a claim about intentionality.

4. Overlap Detection: Identifies temporal overlaps in speech timestamps, indicating
   simultaneous speech events.

5. Directed Interaction Graph: Constructs a weighted directed graph where edges
   represent immediate speaker transitions. Edge weights indicate frequency of
   transitions, revealing patterns of who responds to whom.

6. Agenda Control Indicators: Identifies speakers who initiate new conversational
   segments after silence periods (≥2s), operationalizing topic introduction
   behavior.

Interpretive Constraints:
- No claims are made about speaker intentions, authority, or argumentative quality.
- Metrics describe structural patterns only.
- Normative interpretation (dominant, marginal, aggressive, passive) is left to
  the human analyst.
- Speaker labels are treated as unique nodes without identity inference.

All visualizations use neutral color schemes and prioritize legibility over
aesthetic embellishment.
